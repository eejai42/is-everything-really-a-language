# Article 10: SPARQL — Queries as Computation

Most developers think of SPARQL as a query language. ERB proves it's a computation language. This article shows how formulas compile to SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries that compute derived RDF triples. We walk through the generated queries, run them against rdflib, and demonstrate 100% test accuracy. The insight: if your data is in a triplestore, you don't need a separate application layer for business logic.
