# Article 17: The CMCC Conjecture

The CMCC (Conditions, Mutability, Calculations, and Constraints) Conjecture proposes a fundamental classification of all business logic into four orthogonal categories. This article explores the theoretical foundations of CMCC, how it maps to the ERB architecture, and why separating these concerns enables the multi-substrate projection that powers this system. We examine how each category manifests differently across execution environments—from spreadsheet formulas to SQL constraints to SHACL shapes—while preserving semantic equivalence.
