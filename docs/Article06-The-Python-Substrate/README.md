# Article 6: The Python Substrate — Readable, Testable, Shareable

Python serves as the most accessible execution substrate—readable code that matches the formulas almost 1:1. This article walks through the generated `erb_calc.py` module, shows how it implements the calculation DAG, and demonstrates the test harness. We also explore how other substrates (like YAML) can import and reuse Python calculations, proving that substrates can collaborate rather than exist in isolation.
