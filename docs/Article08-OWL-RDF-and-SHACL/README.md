# Article 8: OWL, RDF, and SHACL — Semantic Web as Computation Platform

The Semantic Web isn't just for knowledge graphs—it's a complete computation environment. This article shows how ERB generates OWL ontologies, RDF instance data, and SHACL-SPARQL rules that compute derived values through reasoning. We trace how a classification formula becomes a SHACL constraint, and demonstrate that pyshacl achieves 100% test accuracy. For anyone who thought RDF was "just data modeling," this is a revelation.
