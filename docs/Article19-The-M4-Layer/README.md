# Article 19: The M4 Layer — Airtable as Meta-Meta-Meta-Model

The OMG's four-layer metamodel architecture (M0-M3) defines how models relate to their instances: M0 is runtime data, M1 is the model, M2 is the metamodel (like UML), and M3 is the meta-metamodel (MOF). But where does the Airtable rulebook fit? This article argues it operates at an implicit M4 layer—a specification so abstract it can project downward into multiple M2/M3 formalisms simultaneously (UML, OWL, SQL DDL, GraphQL SDL). We explore how this perspective explains ERB's power: it's not just code generation, it's metamodel generation. The rulebook doesn't describe a system; it describes the language for describing systems.
