NEIAL-001,LanguageCanBeFormalized,Definition,Motivation,"To avoid the slogan 'Everything is a language', treat 'language' as a typed construct defined by testable properties (syntax, parsing, serialized meaning, and descriptor-role).",,,,,This keeps 'can be interpreted' separate from 'is a language system'.
NEIAL-002,LanguageCanBeFormalized,Definition,PredicateSet,"Use the repo predicates: HasSyntax, RequiresParsing, Meaning_Is_Serialized, IsOntologyDescriptor (spelled IsOngologyDescriptor in the dataset), plus auxiliary checks like CanBeHeld and HasIdentity.","Predicates: Syntax(x), Parse(x), SerializeMeaning(x), OntDesc(x), Tangible(x)",,,,We preserve the dataset's field name even when misspelled to match the generated schema.
NEIAL-003,LanguageCanBeFormalized,Definition,Definition,"Operational definition: an item x counts as a Language if it has syntax, requires parsing, serializes meaning, and functions as an ontology/descriptor system.",Language(x) := HasSyntax(x) ∧ RequiresParsing(x) ∧ Meaning_Is_Serialized(x) ∧ IsOngologyDescriptor(x),,,,This is a deliberately 'strong' definition: it matches formal languages and many natural language representations.
NEIAL-004,LanguageCanBeFormalized,Premise,Witness,There exists at least one clear witness that satisfies the operational definition: English.,∃x (x=English ∧ Language(x)),English,english,HasSyntax=True; RequiresParsing=True; Meaning_Is_Serialized=True; IsOngologyDescriptor=True; CanBeHeld=False; HasIdentity=False; DistanceFromConcept=2; Category=Natural Language,"If any predicate is false in your current dataset for this witness, adjust the candidate record or relax the definition."
NEIAL-005,LanguageCanBeFormalized,Premise,Witness,There exists at least one clear witness that satisfies the operational definition: Python.,∃x (x=Python ∧ Language(x)),Python,python,HasSyntax=True; RequiresParsing=True; Meaning_Is_Serialized=True; IsOngologyDescriptor=True; CanBeHeld=False; HasIdentity=False; DistanceFromConcept=2; Category=Formal Language,"If any predicate is false in your current dataset for this witness, adjust the candidate record or relax the definition."
NEIAL-006,LanguageCanBeFormalized,Conclusion,Conclusion,"Therefore, 'language' can be formalized as a computable classification boundary over explicit predicates.",(Definition ∧ Witnesses) ⇒ Formalizable(Language),,,,This is the concession: language is formalizable (at least operationally).
NEIAL-007,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Premise,Entailment,"If Language(x) is defined by necessary conditions, then any x that fails at least one condition is not a language.",∀x (¬(HasSyntax(x) ∧ RequiresParsing(x) ∧ Meaning_Is_Serialized(x) ∧ IsOngologyDescriptor(x)) → ¬Language(x)),,,,This is the standard move: a definition implies exclusions.
NEIAL-008,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Example,Counterexample,"Counterexample: a chair can be interpreted as a sign (status, design, function), but it does not constitute a language system under the operational definition.",¬Language(Chair),A Chair,,,This separates semiotic availability (can signify) from linguistic structure (has syntax/parsing/serialized meaning).
NEIAL-009,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Example,NonLanguageExample,"Non-language example: A Thunderstorm can be meaningful, but meaning here is not generated by an explicit syntax+parsing+serialization descriptor system.",¬Language(A Thunderstorm),A Thunderstorm,a-thunderstorm,HasSyntax=False; RequiresParsing=True; Meaning_Is_Serialized=False; IsOngologyDescriptor=False; CanBeHeld=False; HasIdentity=True; DistanceFromConcept=1; Category=Physical event,These are strong candidates for 'sign vehicles' rather than 'languages'.
NEIAL-010,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Example,NonLanguageExample,"Non-language example: A Coffee Mug can be meaningful, but meaning here is not generated by an explicit syntax+parsing+serialization descriptor system.",¬Language(A Coffee Mug),A Coffee Mug,a-coffee-mug,HasSyntax=False; RequiresParsing=False; Meaning_Is_Serialized=False; IsOngologyDescriptor=False; CanBeHeld=True; HasIdentity=True; DistanceFromConcept=1; Category=Physical Object,These are strong candidates for 'sign vehicles' rather than 'languages'.
NEIAL-011,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Example,NonLanguageExample,"Non-language example: The Mona Lisa can be meaningful, but meaning here is not generated by an explicit syntax+parsing+serialization descriptor system.",¬Language(The Mona Lisa),The Mona Lisa,the-mona-lisa,HasSyntax=False; RequiresParsing=False; Meaning_Is_Serialized=False; IsOngologyDescriptor=True; CanBeHeld=True; HasIdentity=True; DistanceFromConcept=1; Category=Physical Object,These are strong candidates for 'sign vehicles' rather than 'languages'.
NEIAL-012,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Observation,FuzzyBoundary,"Fuzzy case: A Running App often contains embedded languages (code, UI grammars), but as an executing/interactive process it behaves like a dynamic system rather than a static serialized language artifact.",Borderline(A Running App): may contain ∃y Language(y) but ¬Language(A Running App) under static-serialization criteria,A Running App,,,This is where traditional semiotics' 'anything is a sign' doesn’t neatly distinguish: (1) language-as-system vs (2) meaning-making interactive processes.
NEIAL-013,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Observation,FuzzyBoundary,"Fuzzy case: Running Calculator App often contains embedded languages (code, UI grammars), but as an executing/interactive process it behaves like a dynamic system rather than a static serialized language artifact.",Borderline(Running Calculator App): may contain ∃y Language(y) but ¬Language(Running Calculator App) under static-serialization criteria,Running Calculator App,running-calculator-app,HasSyntax=False; RequiresParsing=True; Meaning_Is_Serialized=False; IsOngologyDescriptor=False; CanBeHeld=False; HasIdentity=True; DistanceFromConcept=1; Category=Running Software,This is where traditional semiotics' 'anything is a sign' doesn’t neatly distinguish: (1) language-as-system vs (2) meaning-making interactive processes.
NEIAL-014,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Observation,FuzzyBoundary,"Fuzzy case: A Game of Fortnite often contains embedded languages (code, UI grammars), but as an executing/interactive process it behaves like a dynamic system rather than a static serialized language artifact.",Borderline(A Game of Fortnite): may contain ∃y Language(y) but ¬Language(A Game of Fortnite) under static-serialization criteria,A Game of Fortnite,a-game-of-fortnite,HasSyntax=False; RequiresParsing=True; Meaning_Is_Serialized=False; IsOngologyDescriptor=False; CanBeHeld=False; HasIdentity=True; DistanceFromConcept=1; Category=Running Software,This is where traditional semiotics' 'anything is a sign' doesn’t neatly distinguish: (1) language-as-system vs (2) meaning-making interactive processes.
NEIAL-015,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Definition,Refinement,Refinement: distinguish LanguageSystem (syntax/parsing/serialization descriptor) from SemioticProcess (interactive/dynamic meaning production) and from SignVehicle (object/phenomenon used as a sign).,Kinds: LanguageSystem(x) | SemioticProcess(x) | SignVehicle(x),,,,This gives you a place to put running apps and games without forcing 'language' to swallow everything.
NEIAL-016,NotEverythingIsALanguage,Conclusion,Conclusion,"Given a formalizable definition of language, not everything is a language; some things are better treated as sign vehicles or semiotic processes, with running applications as a key fuzzy region that benefits from explicit modeling.",Formalizable(Language) ∧ ∃x ¬Language(x) ⇒ ¬(EverythingIsALanguage),,,,This is the repo's thesis in one line.
